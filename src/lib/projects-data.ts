      "Developed a website to assist downtown Calgary professionals in navigating dining options along the Plus 15 skywalk, focusing on recommendations for lunches, client meetings, and post-work socializing within walking distance.

    description:
      "During my time at university majoring in jewelry design, I created a series of steampunk-style insect brooches for my graduation project. The collection featured ants, spiders, beetles, cockroaches, and dragonflies, each designed with the detail characteristic of the steampunk aesthetic. After completing the design drawings, I began 3D modeling and worked on crafting metal elements, such as insect wings, using a saw knife. All parts were secured with screws and fasteners. This approach not only ensured durability but also made the wings movable, giving the brooches a vivid and eye-catching appearance.",

The goal was to demonstrate expertise in Adobe Illustrator and create an animation showcasing Calgary's beauty. I started with sketches and storyboards, selected a specific color palette, and used gradient layers to add contrast. After completing the design, I sequenced the layers and imported them into After Effects for animation. While there's room for improvement in workflow, I'm pleased with the colorful and detailed outcome that captures Calgary's unique character.",
